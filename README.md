* Cholesterol: Dropdown menu with options for 'HIGH', 'LOW', and 'NORMAL'.
* Na_to_K: Numeric input field for the Sodium-to-Potassium ratio.

## Bisinuss problem
=======================
Empowering healthcare with predictive drug analysis, our business harnesses data-driven methodologies to forecast treatment responses, optimize medication choices, and revolutionize patient care. We're dedicated to shaping a future where tailored drug predictions pave the way for personalized and effective healthcare solutions.
## Project Accomplishments and Process Overview
============================================================
• Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.
•	Drop the unique row Identifier if you see any. This step is important as you don’t want your model to build some understanding based on row numbers.
• Split the data into training and testing sets (70-30 split) for model evaluation.
• Handle missing values through imputation or removal based on the amount of missing data and their importance to the analysis.
• Encode categorical variables like 'gender' and 'cholesterol' into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
• Normalize or scale numerical features like 'age', 'bp', and 'na_to_k ratio' to ensure consistent ranges and aid model training. 
• Assess the importance of features through techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance from tree-based models to select relevant attributes for prediction.
• Utilize classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting) to predict the 'drug' based on 'gender', 'age', 'bp', 'cholesterol', and 'na_to_k ratio'.
•	Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score to assess their performance on the test dataset.
•	Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for predictions on new data, considering real-world implications and ethical considerations.
## Deploying a machine learning model with Django
============================================================
• Create a Django Project:
• Set up a new Django project or use an existing one to build the web application. Use Django's structure to manage views, templates, and routes.
• Model Integration:
• Place your trained machine learning model within the Django project. You may want to serialize the model using libraries like joblib or pickle to save and load it.
• Create Views:
• Develop views (functions or classes) within Django to handle user inputs, process requests, and utilize the machine learning model for predictions.
• Design Templates:
• Create HTML templates to render the web pages where users can input data and receive predictions. These templates will be connected to the views.
• Configure URLs:
• Define URL patterns in Django's urls.py file to map views to specific URLs, enabling navigation within the web application.
• Testing and Debugging:
• Test the web application thoroughly, ensuring that user input is handled correctly and model predictions align with expectations.Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.
